** TODO Some docstrings are quite long which lets you pass package-lint and makes for good enough M-x apropos output, but they wrap poorly in M-x help.
** TODO "delimiater" -> "delimiter"
** TODO Since you're using Emacs 25 you can use the string-trim functions (could format-table-trim-row be rewritten as just (string-trim row begin-row end-row)?
** TODO Could the first conditional in format-table-remove-noise be written either as:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (unless (or (string-equal "" cur-line)
                (and regexp (string-match regexp cur-line)))
      (push cur-line ret))
#+END_SRC

*** or, even more aggressively (perhaps even using string-blank-p instead of string-empty-p?):

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (and (not (string-empty-p cur-line))
         (not (and regexp (string-match regexp cur-line)))
         (push cur-line ret))
#+END_SRC

** TODO Could the last conditional in format-table-remove-noise be written with (when ret ...) instead of (if (not ret) nil ...)?
** TODO Rather than

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(let* ((lines (split-string str "[

]+"))...)
#+END_SRC

which incidentally contains two newlines, why not:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(let* ((lines (split-string str "[\n]+")) ...)
#+END_SRC
